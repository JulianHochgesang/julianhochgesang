# Hi üëã, I‚Äôm Julian

Hi, I'm Julian and I love working on new (web) apps that make life easier. I'm also a big fan of open source and like to help with contributions.

## Current (long-term) projects

### üåê SparkView

[Visit official project page ‚Üí](https://www.beyondssl.com/en/products/sparkview/)

SparkView is the hobbyhorse with which many current security problems in SMEs and enterprises are solved. SparkView acts as a kind of middleware and is installed in the company's internal network (or DMZ) on a Windows, Linux or Apple server. Targets such as (virtual) desktops, applications (e.g. ERP, CRM) or servers can then be defined and access rights assigned to individual users on the targets. Users can be created locally or integrated via Active Directory/LDAP/RADIUS. Users access the destinations exclusively via the browser. This means that any end device with a browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge) can be used. Since no data is transferred to the end device, private devices can also be used without any problems. Nothing needs to be installed on the end device.

### üíª SparkView Small Office

SparkView Small Office is a completely pre-installed solution that enables secure remote access with SparkView in small and medium-sized companies via Plug&Play. The solution consists of a mini PC that has Ubuntu, Java and SparkView pre-installed and is ready for immediate use. Once the mini PC has been connected to the internal network, users can access defined company assets such as applications, desktops or servers directly via the browser. SparkView could not be quicker or easier to use.

### üì¶ SparkView Container
